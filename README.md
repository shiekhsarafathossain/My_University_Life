# 🗂️ My Academic Vault

This repo holds everything I’ve gathered during my academic journey —  
from class notes to project files, and all the exam-cracking resources in between.

### Inside you'll find:
- ✅ Important notes
- 💡 Projects & source code
- 📄 Previous exam questions
- 🧠 Study materials I actually use

No fluff — just real, useful stuff.
